# File Organizer Script

A simple Python script that organizes files in a given folder into subfolders based on their file extensions. For example, all `.txt` files will be moved into a `txt_files` folder, `.jpg` files into a `jpg_files` folder, and so on.


# Features
- Automatically creates folders for each file extension.
- Moves files into their respective extension-based folders.
- Skips existing folders (does not move directories).
- Easy to run with minimal setup.
